<span style="color: #DC143C;"><strong>I am planning to graduate in Spring 2025 and am looking for full-time opportunities. Reach out to me if you have any relevant positions!</strong></span>

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), specializing in computational materials science under the supervision of [Dr. Can Ataca](https://physics.umbc.edu/people/faculty/ataca/). I completed my Master of Science in Physics at UMBC in 2021. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Power Engineering (Thermal Engines, Fluid/Gas Dynamics) from Menoufia University in Egypt, which I obtained in 2016. 

## <span style="color: blue; font-size: smaller;">Research Interests</span>

My research interests lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry, machine learning, and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in integrating AI/data science techniques with multiscale atomistic simulations <span style="color: #ff69b4;">(MD/Accelerated MD/MC/KMC/NAMD)</span> and quantum-mechanical calculations <span style="color: #ff69b4;">(DFT/DFPT/DFTB/TFDFT/GW-BSE/QMC)</span> to predict crystal structures, predict electronic-structure properties, and study physical/chemical phenomena at extensive length/time scales that emulate experimental reality.

I am also engaged in designing computational workflows to facilitate multiscale simulations and the machine learning of material properties.

I am currently also interested in the multiscale modeling of non-equilibrium atomistic dynamics in nanoscale devices under external stimuli, excited chemical/physical processes under light/electron/ion beams, and novel material synthesis methodologies.

## <span style="color: blue; font-size: smaller;">Recent News</span>

- **August 2024**: Completed a summer internship at Samsung Semiconductor's Advanced Materials Lab in Cambridge, MA, under the guidance of [Dr. Yongwoo Shin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0R3aEUUAAAAJ&hl=en). I developed a Python package for hybrid KMC/MD simulations within ASE to model the growth of amorphous boron nitride using neural network potentials, and benchmarked the results against TEM experiments.
