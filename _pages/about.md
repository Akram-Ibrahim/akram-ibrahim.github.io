I'm planning to graduate in Spring 2025 and looking for full-time opportunities. Reach out to me if you have any relevant positions!

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), working on computational materials science, under the supervision of [Dr. Can Ataca](https://physics.umbc.edu/people/faculty/ataca/). I obtained my M.S. in Physics from UMBC in 2021. I also got my Bachelor in Mechanical Power Engineering (Thermal Engines, Fluid/Gas Dynamics) from Menoufia University in Egypt in 2016. 

## <span style="color: blue;">Research interests</span>

My research interests lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry, machine learning, and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in combining AI/data science techniques with multiscale atomistic simulations and quantum-mechanical calculations to study physical/chemical phenomena at large length/time scales to get closer to experimental reality.

I also enjoy designing computational workflows facilitating multiscale simulations and machine learning of materials properties. 

I am currently also interested in the multiscale modeling of non-equilibrium atomistic dynamics in nanoscale devices under external stimuli, excited chemical/physical processes under light/electron/ion beams, and novel material synthesis methodologies.

## Recent News

**August 2024**: Completed an internship at Samsung Semiconductor's Advanced Materials Lab in Cambridge, MA, under the guidance of [Dr. Yongwoo Shin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0R3aEUUAAAAJ&hl=en). Developed a Python package for hybrid KMC/MD simulations within the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to model the growth of amorphous boron nitride. Implemented neural network potentials and benchmarked the results against TEM experiments.
