About me: I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), working on computational materials science, under the supervision of Dr. Can Ataca ([https://physics.umbc.edu/people/faculty/ataca/](https://physics.umbc.edu/people/faculty/ataca/)). I obtained my M.S. in Physics from UMBC in 2021. My undergraduate studies were slightly away from computational materials science; it was in Mechanical Power Engineering (studying Thermal Engines, Power Plants/AC Design, Fluid/Gas Dynamics) from Menoufia University in Egypt in 2016. 

Research interests: My research interests lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry, machine learning, and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in combining AI/data science techniques with multiscale atomistic simulations and quantum-mechanical calculations to study physical/chemical phenomena at large length/time scales to get closer to experimental reality. 

    I also enjoy designing computational workflows facilitating multiscale simulations, and machine learning of materials properties. 
    
    I am currently also interested in the multiscale modeling of non-equilibrium atomistic dynamics in nanoscale devices under external stimuli, excited chemical/physical processes under light/electron/ion beams, and novel material synthesis methodologies.

## Research Experience

### Machine-Learned Multiscale Modeling and Electronic Structure

- **Lithium Adsorption on 2D Materials**: Designed physics-based descriptors for Li adsorption processes and applied cluster-wise linear regression to predict Li adsorption energies on two-dimensional (2D) regular and Janus transition metal dichalcogenides at varying Li concentrations.

- **Chemical Exfoliation Modeling**: Developed neural network potentials (NNPs) for non-stoichiometric disordered environments in chemically exfoliated non-van der Waals materials. Analyzed generalization for configurational and geometric optimization against cluster expansion methods. Utilized the NNP for simulated annealing to predict Cr(1-x)S crystal structures and in vacancy diffusion Monte Carlo simulations to study non-van der Waals to van der Waals phase transitions under lateral strain.

- **Defect Dynamics in MoS₂ Monolayers**: Created an equivariant NNP for MoS₂ monolayers with varying sulfur vacancy concentrations. Utilized the NNP to drive kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations modeling equilibrium dynamics and vacancy agglomeration into extended defects for resistive switching devices.

- **Frequency-Dependent Optical Spectrum Prediction**: Developed multi-output graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict frequency-dependent dielectric functions and absorption coefficients from generic crystal structures, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators, across IR to UV spectra. Enhanced model accuracy using multifidelity learning strategies. Demonstrated improved learning of solar cell performance parameters through frequency-dependent GNNs with target-specific learning biases.

- **Platinum-Functionalized Graphene**: Collaborated with NASA Goddard experimentalists to predict crystal structures and growth dynamics of platinum on graphene for advanced gas sensors. Employed an equivariant NNP for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore Pt growth modes at varied concentrations. Modeled hydrogen adsorption and storage on optimized Pt/graphene structures via MD simulations.

- **Surface Oxidation of Rare-Earth Tritellurides (RTe₃)**: Worked with experimentalists at Arizona State University to conduct DFT simulations investigating the oxidation mechanisms of RTe₃ materials. Explained the oxidation trends and resilience observed experimentally across different rare-earth elements.

- **Magnetic Properties of 2D Materials**: Conducted DFT+U non-collinear magnetic calculations for multiferroic NiI₂ monolayers. Analyzed exchange interactions and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions to determine ground-state spin spiral wavelengths and orientations. Developed a Python code for spin Monte Carlo simulations with customizable Hamiltonians to study magnetic thermodynamics and calculate transition temperatures under variable strains.
