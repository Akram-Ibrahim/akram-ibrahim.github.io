<span style="color: maroon; font-size: smaller;">I'm planning to graduate in Spring 2025 and am looking for full-time opportunities. Reach out to me if you have any relevant positions!</span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), working on computational materials science under the supervision of [Dr. Can Ataca](https://physics.umbc.edu/people/faculty/ataca/). I obtained my M.S. in Physics from UMBC in 2021. I also earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Power Engineering (focusing on Thermal Engines, Fluid/Gas Dynamics) from Menoufia University in Egypt in 2016. 

## <span style="color: blue; font-size: smaller;">Research Interests</span>

My research interests lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics, materials science, chemistry, machine learning, and mathematics. Broadly, I am interested in combining AI/data science techniques with multiscale atomistic simulations and quantum-mechanical calculations to study physical and chemical phenomena at large length and time scales to approach experimental reality.

I also enjoy designing computational workflows to facilitate multiscale simulations and the machine learning of materials properties. 

I am currently also interested in the multiscale modeling of non-equilibrium atomistic dynamics in nanoscale devices under external stimuli, including excited chemical/physical processes under light/electron/ion beams, and novel material synthesis methodologies.

## <span style="color: blue; font-size: smaller;">Recent News</span>

**August 2024**: Completed a summer internship at Samsung Semiconductor's Advanced Materials Lab in Cambridge, MA, under the guidance of [Dr. Yongwoo Shin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0R3aEUUAAAAJ&hl=en). I developed a Python package for hybrid KMC/MD simulations within ASE to model the growth of amorphous boron nitride using neural network potentials, and benchmarked the results against TEM experiments.
